# Introduction to hotbits

This is a toy library to grab hotbits (random data, ususally hex, 
generated from radioactive decay or [*something amazing like that*](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/))
from fourmilab.ch's HotBits servers.  

If you __need__ random data, you have to use something that doesn't rely on 
pseudorandom number generators (ie your computer's terrible method).
